     * Since serialization and deserialization fall among the most expensive calculations
     * that a system can do, codecs are expected optimize these operations considerably.
     * An example of it is instead of storing fully qualified class name along with the
     * object, the codec can store an integer for it. This creates a mapping from an integer
     * to fully qualified class name and is only known to the codec instance which
     * serializes the object using this information. We call this dynamically changing
     * knowledge (mapping) a state. For deserializer instance to do its job, it also needs
     * to have this knowledge and can be passed through the state variable.
     *
     * Note that the state is incremental so it's additive to previous state. It does not
     * replace it. If state does not change during serialization, this field can be set to
     * null. Otherwise it will be delivered to all the instances of deserializing codecs of
     * this serializer in the same order as it was created. Due to the nature of the partitioning
     * the accompanying data field may not make it to the deserializer.
